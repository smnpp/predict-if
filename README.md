# PREDICT'IF

## About
Predictâ€™IF is a telephone clairvoyance service developed by engineering students. The service connects a client with a chosen psychic for a consultation. The psychic can address various types of consultations, whether sentimental, professional, or psychological. When the client selects their desired psychic, an employee is then assigned to that psychic based on their gender and the number of consultations they have performed. All interactions are recorded in a centralized database, allowing for the consultation of clients, employees, psychics, and their consultations. Additionally, the application provides employees with various relevant statistics.

## Features
